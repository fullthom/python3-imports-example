A short demonstration of the python module system.
There is some nuance into what syntax can be used
when.
Attention is given to the creation of custom modules.

I made this to better understand the system after some
confusion while working on a larger python project.

If you find a mistake (and there probably are some) or 
something important missing (and there probably is) 
feel free to make a PR.

Read the inline comments for explanations of what is going on.
