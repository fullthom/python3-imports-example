A short demonstration of the python module system.
There is some nuance into what syntax can be used
when, and I made this to help me better understand the differences.
Attention is given to the creation of custom modules.

If you find a mistake (and there probably are some) or 
something important missing (and there probably is) 
feel free to make a PR.
